# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables (Variables in Javascript are like boxes that hold things. You give them names, just like labeling a box of Pokémon cards, so you can find it quickly. Use good names, so you know exactly what’s inside — like ‘Ultimate Pokémon Deck')

	* Strings (sequence of characters for example. John Doe)

	* Functions (arguments, `return`) (Functions are like cooking recipes or the instructions that come with a LEGO set. Running a function goes through each of the steps until it reaches the end or is told to stop)

	* `if` statements - runs different paths (If you are running along a side walk and there is someone you don't like there then you will take a different path home)

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) (yes or no) (lights on of off)


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
