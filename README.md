# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
		A variable in programming is like can be likened to how we use cups in real life. A cup is used as a means of holding stuff to use now or to be used later. You can pour a bottle of water into 5 cups, pour one of the the cups of out and replace it with milk etc etc.

		Variables in this sense are 'cups' that hold bits of information/data for you when programming. You can create a variable (cup) and store data in it that can be used later in the code you are writing. The 'vary' in variable is very appropriate because data stored in a variable can be changed anytime the code is run. You can at any point in time, change the information/data that is held in a particular variable (cup) to something else.

		Variables are either local or global. Local variables can be used or are limited to only the function in which they were created. Global variables however can be used anywhere in the code

	* Strings
		A string is simply a sequence of one or more characters. A string could be made up of digits, alphapets, symbols and literally just any character. To however tell an interpreter what is a string and what is not, strings are normally denoted by wrapping quotes around them. Example 'food', "123546415" are strings but 123454433 without the quotes cannot be classified a string
		It is one of a number of programming data types (classifications of data that tell a programming language's compiler how to execute a particular data)

	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
		Functions are reusable blocks of code that are defined in a program. Normally when programming, there are many features or blocks of code performing a specific function, that will be used in multiple places in the code. It makes sense not to be writing the same code that does the same thing hundreds of times in your program. That's when functions come in.

		A function can be created to accept certain arguments or parameters, do something with the parameters passed to it and then 'return' a certain result. 

		Let's say we are creating a program and in multiple instances in that program, we will need the square root of any number passed to it to be returned to the user along with some kind of personalised message.To do this, we can create a function to accept an 'argument', in our case, the number whose square root we want displayed. We can then, in the function, write code to 'return'(display) the square root of the argument (number) passed, along with whatever personalised message we want.

	* `if` statements
		'if' statements can also be referred to as conditionals/conditional statements. There are many instances in coding when you want one thing to happen when a particular thing happens and another thing to be displayed when that particular event doesn't happen. 

		A classical example of 'if' statements in use will be when you are logging on to facebook. You are required to enter your username and password. If you enter the correct username and password, you are given access to you facebook account. On the other hand, if a wrong username or password or both is entered, an error message appears prompting you to enter the correct combination of username and password.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

		A Boolean is a data type (classifications of data that tell a programming language's compiler how to execute a particular data). It is one of the ways in which decisions are made when coding.Its normally used to determine whether a condition is true or false. When a boolean expression is used, its value can only be true or false. There cannot be a third option.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	Done	

3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3
	Done

4. Download this project folder from GitHub.
	Done

5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.
	Done

6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.
	Done

7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
	Done
