# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: Are storage locations that are usually defined by their identifier. They may contain information or data and are used primarily to store data. 
	* Strings: A type of sequence of characters, either literal or as a variable. For example any type of text.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): Functions are an important aspect in Javascript. JavaScript is sometimes reffered to as a functional programming language. Functions are declared with the `function` keyword and can hold many lines of code or blocks. Executing a function is also known as `calling` a function. When you call a function, you pass a value to its paramater this value is known as an argument. Functions can store many arguments in their paramaters. Paramaters are the way in which a function stores the value passed on as an argument. Functions can sometimes return values or execute pieces of code without returning anything. To return you use the `return` keyword. The Program always returns to the last point where the function was called.
	* `if` statements: Are conditional statements used to test conditions. These can be simply explained by looking at a persons everyday routine. If it is rainy outside, chances are the person is going to stay home and watch movies. Else if the weather is sunny, maybe the person will decide to go to the pool or beach. 
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Values that are also known as state values. Booleans can either be `0` or `1`, or `true` or `false`. Very useful when declaring a flag for a loop or when a condition has to be met explicitly. Also handy for creating infinite loops.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
