# Feynman Writing Prompts

Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

##My Definitions:
---
		
1.  '`Variables`: When writing instructions within a computer program, variables (ex. “var name”) are used to store values, such as a person’s name (ex. var name = ‘Ben’;); ‘name’ being the variable, and ‘Ben’ being the stored value.  ‘Ben’ is a “string” of text however, variables can also be used to represent numbers OR Booleans (returns true or false).
2.  `Strings`: A line of text (although numbers and other symbols can also be included).  
3.  `Functions (arguments, return)`: Functions are like value calculating machines designed to run specific input values, (numbers, strings, or booleans) through a series of changes, and then submit the resultant output values.  We call the variables used to represent the input value(s) “arguments” whilte the output values are given following the “return” command.
4.  `if statements`: If statements are used to add conditions within a function.  For example, if you don’t use if statements, then the function addTwo (num) will always simply addTwo to any number you provide, and return the value; however, if you want the addTwo function to only add two to the input value num if it is even, and if not, return the odd value unaltered, then you would need an “if statement”.
5.  `Boolean values (true, false)`:A type of variable value, which unlike strings, which print text, and numbers, which print numerical values; print whether a variable or calculated value is true or false.  Booleans can be used and manipulated in much the same way that strings and numbers are within functions.
