# Feynman Prompt

1. Variables: Variables are analogous to envelopes. Creaing a varibale is like that you take an envelope and write down a nice name on it. And then assigning a value to the variable is like putting some information into it. When you need the value, you simply write the name of the variable in your code, which is like opening the envelope and taking the information out. You can always assign a new value to a variable, it is like putting new information into to the envelope but you will destroy whatever was there before.

2. Strings: Strings are one type of data used in coding. Strings are like sentences. They can be used to communicate information from the program to the user of the program. For example, a string can be "Hello, nice to meet you!"

3. Functions: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in coding. A function is a block of reusable code that performs a task. It takes in data which are usually called "arguments", and return a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over again with different arguments. 

4. If statements: You always have to make choices in your life. For example, if the weather is good tomorrow, we are going to picnic; else, we are going to do something different. These "things" are called conditions. In "if" statments, all conditions must evaluate to either ture or false.

5. Boolean values: Boolean values are another type of data in JavaScript. Boolean has two possible values: true or false. The statements in a () after the "if" key word is usually a boolean value or a boolean expression. For example, in "if (5 < 4)", the expression "(5 < 4)" will be evaluated to the value `false`,
