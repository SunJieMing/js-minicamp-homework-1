Variables
    
      Variables hold data. Data are things like sequences of characters that form words, and numbers. Data has a binary
      representation in memory.
    
Strings
    
      Strings are sequences of characters. They are like arrays of characters.
    
Functions (arguments, return)
    
      Functions help you encapsulate code into reusable chunks. If you find yourself repeating the same chunk of code in many
      places, you might consider putting that code in a function. You can parameterize a function, allowing it to perform actions on
      data you give it, or to specify the function should run a certain way. You pass the arguments in for the parameters and the
      function can use them in whatever way it wants. Functions can return a value, but they don't have to. If the function returns
      a value, you can think of the function call as an expression that evaluates to its return value.
    
if statements
    
      If statements are one of the ways to control the execution flow of your program. Programs run straight down from the top,
      except when there are flow control statements involved. The if statement allows you to selectively execute chunks of code,
      and skip others. If you have a piece of code that should only run if a certain condition is true, then you may use an if
      statement in that situation.
      
Boolean values (true, false)
    
      Boolean values consist of the value true and the value false. They are represented in binary by 1 and 0. You can think of
      true as on and false as off. Booleans are used to represent conditions. Recall that you use conditions for control flow
      statements like the if statement.
