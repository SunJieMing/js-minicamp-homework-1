Variables 

Variables are like buckets. They can store data, references to other things, & 'objects'.
When we declare a variable, we write it like this:

var firstName = Bill;


Strings

Strings are places where you can store text inside of quotes. Make sure the beginning and ending quotes match each other. Here's an example:

var x = 'Hello!'




Functions (arguments, return)

Functions are what you use to tell the code to do something. Another thing 'calls' the functions to say 'do this'. The function has a name, and parentheses ( ) come after that, with any parameters like x, y separated by commas. Then the code which the function orders to 'do this' inside curly braces { }. 

Here's an example:

function MyMultiplicationTime (x,y) {
  return x * y;
}

//This function returns the product of parameter X multiplied by parameter y.

//Arguments are the values produced when the function is called (ordered to run).
//You can use a function as a variable itself.


if statements

//If statements are used to make your code do different things depending on different decisions.
Make sure to use lowercase letters only to write if statements. 

//You are telling the code, Do this, if something is true.
else is used to tell the code, Do this other thing instead, if that something is false. 

//Here's an example of code to say whether someone is being permitted to drive a car or not, based on the age:

if (age > 18) {
  document.write ('<b>You can drive</b>'); }

else {
  document.write ('<b>You are not old enough to drive</b>'); }


Boolean values (true, false)

A Boolean value can be only true or false.  You can write the Boolean () function this way:

Boolean (5 > 4)
//The code will ask, is 5 greater than 4? The result is: true. 
//You can also use < to say less than, or == for equal to , such if (month == 'August')
